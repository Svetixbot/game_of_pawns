I won't be able to do this, but:

[ ] Board should be owned by board module.
[ ] I'd like to move parsing of args into get_mode() function, but rust is hard.
[ ] Write assumptions (distance between kings, parsing of args).
[ ] Move pieces into constants. And use them everywhere instead of chars. They should belong to pieces module.
[ ] Generator is a function, it can be injected into pieces and board modules to make them deterministic.
